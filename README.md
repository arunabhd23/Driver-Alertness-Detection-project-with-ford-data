# Driver-Alertness-Detection-project-with-ford-data
In this project, various classification algorithms were applied to predict driver alertness, with a focus on identifying the most effective model. After extensive testing and validation, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99% on the validation dataset. Key skills utilized in this project included Python for coding, Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models, and Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis. The process also involved thorough data preprocessing, model validation, and performance testing to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the results.
